Picture civilizations emerging like stars in the celestial tale of the ages. Sumeria and Egypt, awakened in 4000 BC, and America''s fire igniting in 1776 AD. Elect thine path: era''s embrace or year''s precision. In the wake of new arrivals, revolutions shall stir, sweeping cityscapes with conversions and free city rebellions. Bonuses and legions, a dance of progress and era''s sway. As isolation daunts, revere not the lack of boon, or in colonial fervor, march forth! Cast unto the realm unseen, the curtain lifts only at thy destined hour. In this realm, ye script thy destiny anew.[NEWLINE]'),
